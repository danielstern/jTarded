The library of really stupid things you can do in JavaScript.

    var Q = lol.irrelevant("whales")
    // That's irrelevant.
    
    var G = lol.unnecessaryQuotes('I think I will go a run today')
    // I think I'll go for a "run" today.

    var K = lol.toWizard(myFunction);
    // returns myFunction with an extra property, .enchant(), which enchants the argument.
    
    var M = lol.obviously("Orange");
    //"too obvious to keep in memory
